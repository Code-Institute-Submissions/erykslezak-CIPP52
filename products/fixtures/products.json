By simply adding the packet of HI-702-25 reagent to the sample, the reaction will take place and the HI-702 will determine the concentration from the colour that is produced. The results will be displayed in ppm of copper. These reagents are designed to be used with samples that have an expected range of 0.00 to 5.00 ppm copper.",

To obtain accurate measurements, remove such bubbles by swirling or by gently tapping the cuvette. Do not let the reacted sample stand for too long after reagent is added, or accuracy will be lost. After the reading, it is important to discard the sample immediately, otherwise the glass might become permanently stained.",
