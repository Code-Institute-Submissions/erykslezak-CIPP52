## **User stories / Strategy**

The below MOSCOW table consists of user stories with story points and MOSCOW principles. All of the stories in the table below are what I believe I needed in order to produce a good user friendly e-commerce store. I completed all of them within timeframe. Each user story was tested and they can be found HERE.

The wireframes were successfully converted into a live functioning website across all devices.

The full suite of wireframes for **desktop**, **tablet** and **mobile** devices, can be accessed [here](wireframes/).

## **Design**

<span id="ux-design"></span>

### **Colour Scheme**

After looking through different e-commerce shops related to fish/corals, I concluded that the best color scheme would be a simple **plain white background with blue accents**. The below is the colours I have used the most.

![Coolors](docs/aquaria-supplies-coolors.png)

### **Typography**

For fonts I decided to go with something that is simple and elegant. The fonts are as follows, Lato and Sans-serif. I think it gives site nice and clear look and ease of readability.
