## **User stories / Strategy**

The below MOSCOW table consists of user stories with story points and MOSCOW principles. All of the stories in the table below are what I believe I needed in order to produce a good user friendly e-commerce store. I completed all of them within timeframe. Each user story was tested and they can be found HERE.
